# toDoList
# Project 0(Harvard X CS50M(Audit course))

The goal of this project is to practice JavaScript and its paradigms by creating
a TODO app. This app should be able to add TODOs and track the number of total
TODOs as well as the number of unchecked TODOs.

## Files
### Index.html: A starter file for front-end
### style.css: Style sheet
### script.js: Create the todo list dynamically.
